# Overview & Basic Rules  
##### This document is a good Science Olympiad Codebusters C Guide, and it has links and resources attached, along with basic explanations for all of the ciphers.  
> **SIMPLY READING THIS DOCUMENT WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SOLVE CIPHERS!** In order to properly understand the ciphers, you must apply rules stated in this document to numerous practice questions.
> The best resource to use for Codebusters is here: https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Codebusters
##### Rules Breakdown
> Teams of 3 people will solve 21 Â± 13 questions in 50 minutes. Only a basic 4 faced calculator is allowed (no graphing or scientific calculators allowed). 
> Tip: Do not stress out about not finishing all of the ciphers on time. Try to be able to solve questions faster with many practice problems, but do note that even the top teams will only solve like 8-9 questions correctly. Pick the ones you can solve, and if you are unable how to do a cipher, don't attempt it.  
##### Question Point Breakdown
> An easy question: 100-150 points  
> A medium question: 200-300 points  
> A hard question: 350-500 points  
> A very hard question: 550-700 points  
# Basic Vocabulary  
> A cipher is a key/rule to conceal information.  


# Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers

##### caesar (difficulty: N/A)
> The Caesar Cipher involves universal letter shifts by a certain index. A Caesar Cipher can be solved by listing the 25 other letter shifts from the original. This cipher is the only cipher on the list that isn't asked as it's own question on the Scioly exam, but rather used as an index in other ciphers. THIS IS SOMETHING I ADDED WITH VISUAL STUDIO CODE.

##### aristocrat (difficulty: easy)
> The Aristocrat involves each letter substituting for exactly one other letter. The spaces are preserved, and the words are spelled correctly. This cipher is based on intutition and understanding of words. Some tips are first start with identifying the letter 'a', as it is used as a one-letter article in 'a' and a two-letter article 'an'. If you see a repeated three letter word before many phrases, we can assume those three letters represent 'the' if they are all different and haven't been taken yet. I would also reccomend familiarizing yourself with many two letter and three letter words that are commonly used in English, and understand how commonly used words are used. (EX: ABCEC, and we know that C=E and A=W, you should be able to realize that ABCEC=WHERE.) You also need to make sure that all of the letter substitutions make sense, and make sure that vowels and consonants are placed in a way in all words where it could possibly form a real word.

##### aristocrat mispelled (difficulty: hard)
> The Aristocrat Mispelled is the same as the Aristocrat, except some letters are mispelled. This uncertainty of the words make the cipher a lot more challenging to solve.

##### patristocrat (difficulty: extremely hard)
> The Patristocrat is one of the hardest ciphers, because the spaces are not preserved. The Patristocrat has 'spaces' between each 5 letters, but these spaces are to be ignored, as they are only for counting purposes (not very useful). You are usually given an 'crib word' which is typically 5-7 letters, and can be solved with a Caesar Cipher (I would reccomend using all indexes between -6 and 6, as it usually contains the solve for the crib word). The crib word will always be somewhere in the cipher text. The most common digram (aka 2 letter string) is 'TH', the most common trigram (aka 3 letter string) is 'THE'. Find the letters that appear in this sequence the most, and do the substitution. After that, try to find a place where the crib word would logically be used based on the substitution you made with 'TH' and 'THE'. 

##### xenocrypt (difficulty: extremely hard)  
> The Xenocrypt is basically an Aristocrat in a different language (there will be ONE Spanish Xenocrypt at most on the test). Sometimes, a crib word is given for this cipher; and you must find a location where this crib would fit in the ciphertext, and substitute all of the other letters accordingly. From there, you can probably try to make logical words that exist in that language that would make sense given on the context of the substituted crib word.
