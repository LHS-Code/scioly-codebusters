# Linguistic Ciphers

## caesar (difficulty: extremely easy)
> The Caesar Cipher involves universal letter shifts by a certain index. A Caesar Cipher can be solved by listing the 25 other letter shifts from the original. This cipher is the only cipher on the list that isn't asked as it's own question on the Scioly exam, but rather used as an index in other ciphers. 

## aristocrat (difficulty: easy/medium)
> The Aristocrat involves each letter substituting for exactly one other letter. The spaces are preserved, and the words are spelled correctly. This cipher is based on intutition and understanding of words. Some tips are first start with identifying the letter 'a', as it is used as a one-letter article in 'a' and a two-letter article 'an'. If you see a repeated three letter word before many phrases, we can assume those three letters represent 'the' if they are all different and haven't been taken yet. I would also reccomend familiarizing yourself with many two letter and three letter words that are commonly used in English, and understand how commonly used words are used. (EX: ABCEC, and we know that C=E and A=W, you should be able to realize that ABCEC=WHERE.) You also need to make sure that all of the letter substitutions make sense, and make sure that vowels and consonants are placed in a way in all words where it could possibly form a real word.

## aristocrat mispelled (difficulty: hard)
> The Aristocrat Mispelled is the same as the Aristocrat, except some letters are mispelled. This uncertainty of the words make the cipher a lot more challenging to solve.

## patristocrat (difficulty: hard)
> The Patristocrat is one of the hardest ciphers, because the spaces are not preserved. The Patristocrat has 'spaces' between each 5 letters, but these spaces are to be ignored, as they are only for counting purposes (not very useful). You are usually given an 'crib word' which is typically 5-7 letters, and can be solved with a Caesar Cipher (I would reccomend using all indexes between -6 and 6, as it usually contains the solve for the crib word). The crib word will always be somewhere in the cipher text. The most common digram (aka 2 letter string) is 'TH', the most common trigram (aka 3 letter string) is 'THE'. Find the letters that appear in this sequence the most, and do the substitution. After that, try to find a place where the crib word would logically be used based on the substitution you made with 'TH' and 'THE'.
