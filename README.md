# English Ciphers

## caesar
> The Caesar Cipher involves universal letter shifts by a certain index. A Caesar Cipher can be solved by listing the 25 other letter shifts from the original. This cipher is the only cipher on the list that isn't asked as it's own question on the Scioly exam, but rather used as an index in other ciphers. 

## aristocrat
> The Aristocrat involves each letter substituting for exactly one other letter. The spaces are preserved, and the words are spelled correctly. This cipher is based on intutition and understanding of words. Some tips are first start with identifying the letter 'a', as it is used as a one-letter article in 'a' and a two-letter article 'an'. If you see a repeated three letter word before many phrases, we can assume those three letters represent 'the' if they are all different and haven't been taken yet. I would also reccomend familiarizing yourself with many two letter and three letter words that are commonly used in English, and understand how commonly used words are used. (EX: ABCEC, and we know that C=E and A=W, you should be able to realize that ABCEC=WHERE.) You also need to make sure that all of the letter substitutions make sense, and make sure that vowels and consonants are placed in a way in all words where it could possibly form a real word.
